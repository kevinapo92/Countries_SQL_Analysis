# World_SQL_Analysis

## Introduction 
Welcome to my SQL analysis of different metrics of countries around the world. In this project, I explore various economic, social, and demographic indicators to gain insights into global trends and patterns. By analyzing data from different countries, I aim to identify similarities and differences in areas such as population growth, income levels, education rates, and more.

This project is intended for anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the global landscape, from policymakers to researchers to curious learners. By providing access to my code and insights, I hope to inspire further exploration and discussion of the topics covered.

## Technologies Used

* SQL (Structured Query Language)
* MySQL IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
* MySQL Workbench (Database design and modeling tool)
* MySQL Server (Relational database management system)

In this project, I utilized SQL as my primary programming language to analyze and manipulate data. To interact with the databases I used MySQL Workbench As IDE.

## Data Source
The data used in this project was obtained from the world sample database, which contains information about countries, cities, and languages spoken around the world. This database was provided by MySQL and can be downloaded in the form of a compressed tar file or Zip archive from their website at https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html. The database contains three tables: country, city, and countrylanguage. The country table provides information about countries, such as name, population, and region. The city table contains data on some of the cities in those countries, including their names, populations, and the countries in which they are located. The countrylanguage table lists the languages spoken in each country, along with information about the percentage of the population that speaks each language.

Throughout this project, I utilized the data provided in these tables to explore various economic, social, and demographic indicators.
